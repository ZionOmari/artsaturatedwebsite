# Interactive Feature Proposals

## Current Mechanic
The app features a grayscale fog overlay that users can brush away with their cursor to reveal colorful content underneath. The fog automatically regrows after 10 seconds of inactivity.

## Proposed New Features

### 1. ðŸŒŸ Particle Trail System (IMPLEMENTING FIRST)
**Concept**: When users brush away the fog, leave behind dynamic particle trails that follow cursor movement and react to interaction intensity.

**Features**:
- Glowing particles spawn along the brush path
- Particle intensity varies with cursor speed (faster = more particles)
- Particles slowly fade and drift with subtle physics
- Different particle colors based on revealed background colors
- Particles create a "magical brush" effect that enhances the feeling of painting

**Technical Implementation**: Canvas-based particle system with position tracking, velocity calculations, and fade animations.

### 2. ðŸŽµ Sound-Reactive Fog Patterns
**Concept**: Ambient audio analysis influences fog regeneration patterns, creating dynamic visual responses to sound.

**Features**:
- Microphone input analyzes frequency spectrum
- Fog pulses and ripples based on audio intensity
- Different frequencies create different pattern types (bass = ripples, treble = sparkles)
- Users can hum, whistle, or play music to create custom fog effects
- Optional ambient soundscape that users can interact with
- Volume-based fog clearing strength

**Technical Implementation**: Web Audio API for frequency analysis, real-time canvas pattern generation based on audio data.

### 3. ðŸ§  Memory Heat Map System
**Concept**: Persistent tracking of user interaction patterns that influences fog behavior in frequently brushed areas.

**Features**:
- Heat map tracks cumulative brush activity across sessions
- "Memory zones" develop where users frequently interact
- These zones have special behaviors:
  - Fog clears faster in hot zones
  - Fog stays clear longer in memory areas
  - Special colors/content revealed in heavily used areas
  - Visual indicators show heat map intensity
- Data persists using localStorage
- Heat map slowly decays over time to keep it dynamic

**Technical Implementation**: Pixel-based heat map data structure, localStorage persistence, graduated visual effects based on interaction frequency.

## Implementation Priority
1. **Particle Trail System** - Most immediate visual impact, enhances existing interaction
2. **Memory Heat Map** - Adds long-term engagement and personalization
3. **Sound-Reactive Patterns** - Most complex but creates unique audio-visual experience
